## Introduction

The CLIâ€‘based system recommends the career paths based on the interest mentioned; the user must select one of the Career Paths among many to proceed further. The user selects the fundamental career courses done and provides GPA, and the system offers suggestions for the electives.

## Contents of the Repo
* [Code.pl](https://github.com/abhit-rana/Electives-Advisory-System/blob/main/Code.pl): This file contains the Prolog code for the logic behind this system. Career Path recommendation is made by seeing the interest mentioned aligns with which career. The code determines which advanced courses could be taken in the selected career path given the fundamental courses and the student's GPA.
* [Interface.py](https://github.com/abhit-rana/Electives-Advisory-System/blob/main/Interface.py): The file contains the Python code to design the Interface for interacting with the Prolog code. It uses Natural Language Processing techniques to determine the content in the user inputs and generates the Natural Language Output through a Rule-based technique.
* [ExplanationAndExamples](https://github.com/abhit-rana/Electives-Advisory-System/blob/main/ExplanationAndExamples.pdf): This file contain depth explanation of logic in COde.pl and Interface.py. It also contains examples of the system advising electives.
